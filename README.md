# BidTracker
An assigment set by Numerics

The project was built as follows 

	- Test Cases are created using JUnit 4 and not JUnit 5. JUnit Jars were added to the project as external jars.
	- The project uses eclipse plugin - Infinitest to run the test cases automatically.
	- Built using Maven instead of Gradle
	- I used System.out.println instead of Log4J due to time.
	- The project requires minimum Java 8
